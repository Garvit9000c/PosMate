## Problem Statement

- *"Are you sure you are sitting in a correct posture right now when you are looking at your desktop screen reading this problem statement?" No, right?*

- *"With the underlying Pandemic at place, Programmers/Students/working professionals are spending more Time with there laptop, working out day and night!"* 


**"The wrong Posture of Sitting with Minimal Breaks In this Digital Era with Average Screen-time More than 5 hours, are deteriorating Life quality Standards by leading to problems related to Spinal cord, gastrology, weakening of eyesight and many more consequences which eventually affects the work-life which we were onto”**


## Our Hack
A **Robust AI-Driven System** (Web App) That Monitors :
- **Posture** (7 Body KeyPoints)
- **Relative Distance** from Display

**Which Notifies User when his/her Posture or Relative Distance is Wrong with a Suggestion on how to improve it!**
Using 
- **CNN** And **ANN** Model
- **Tensorflow.js/ Movenet3.0** with Client Side Rendering.
