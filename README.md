# __POSTURE MATE__
## Problem Statement

"Are you sure you are sitting in a correct posture right now when you are looking at your desktop screen reading this problem statement?" No, right ?

__With the underlying Pandemic__ in place, everything went Online from classroom to offices and as a result, most of us are _sitting almost 7-9 hours per day_ in front of laptop/pc with either _sitting in the shape of C curve_ or _your head at a certain angle instead of being straight_ which ultimately results in problems related with Spinal cord,  gastrology, weakening of eyesight and many more which eventually affects the work which we were onto.

Also many of us working the average 9-5 don’t have the option to stretch regurarly, especially if the nature of the work is very demanding. This means sitting in one position for about 6-8 hours __(speaking of regular days, irrespective of Work from Home)__. This also means having both long and short term effects of sitting that could prove harmful to one’s health.

We know that by reading few articles on [correct posture while working](https://www.work-fit.com/blog/how-to-sit-properly-at-your-desk) one won't know what an individual should do to get rid of this issue so here we are solving this problem with Artificial Intelligence.
