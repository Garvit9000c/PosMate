## Problem Statement / Inspiration

- *"Are you sure you are sitting in a correct posture right now when you are looking at your desktop screen reading this problem statement?" No, right?*

- *"With the underlying Pandemic at place, Programmers/Students/working professionals are spending more Time with there laptop, working out day and night!"* 


**"The wrong Posture of Sitting with Minimal Breaks In this Digital Era with Average Screen-time More than 5 hours, are deteriorating Life quality Standards by leading to problems related to Spinal cord, gastrology, weakening of eyesight and many more consequences which eventually affects the work-life which we were onto”**


## Our Hack / What it does!

A **Robust AI-Driven System** (Web App) That Monitors :
- **Posture** (7 Body KeyPoints)
- **Relative Distance** from Display

**Which Notifies User when his/her Posture or Relative Distance is Wrong with a Suggestion on how to improve it!**
Using 
- **CNN** And **ANN** Model
- **Tensorflow.js/ Movenet3.0** with Client Side Rendering.

## Algorithm / How we Build it!

## Challenges We Ran Into!
> Detecting Body Coordinate with Computer-Vision Efficiently.
  - 7 Body Keypoints Detection with Movenet3.0 CNN Model with 30-40fps frame rates.

> Classification of Each Sample with More Accuracy in different Environments.
  - Artificial neural networks for Posture classification

> Effective Alerts about Wrong Posture.
  - Smart Sound Alerts with text Notifications.

> Making It Easier For Diverse User, to Use Our App!
  - Minimalist UI/UX

> Server-Load & Data Breach/Consumption Problem.
 - Client-Side AI rendering which reduces server load Drastically with no Data Going Over Server.

## What we Learned:
- Deploying AI model at Client-Side with Tensorflow.js
- Artificial Neural Network Classification & Convolutional Neural Network
- Automated Data Collection & Labeling with Google Forms

## What Next:
- Scaling the Web-app to Chrome Extension.
- Automated Exercise Guidance Model.
- Monitoring Screen Time for Better Suggestions.

## Technologies Used / Build With:
> Python/Flask/Heroku

> HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/Bootstrap

> Tensorflow.js / SkLearn / Movenet
